#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I made a gift for you today.  
It's a map for you to take on your journey to a better future.  

If you ever feel lost, look at your map then close your eyes and imagine the warm sun on your skin, the soft breeze on your cheek, the smell of flowers and feel the rich soil between your toes.  

Remember every day that you are loved and continue to share this love with everyone around you. 

~ The Map Maker (Melioratus)
